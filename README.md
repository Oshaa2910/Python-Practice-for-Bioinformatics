# ðŸ§¬ Python Practice for Bioinformatics

This repository is a collection of my **bioinformatics practice projects** implemented in Python. In this repo I am learning and practicing python to solve biological problems.
<br>
Each task is organized into a separate folder with Python scripts and (when needed) sample datasets.
<br>
Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `biopython` (as needed)
<br>
<br>
This is a **learning and practice repo**, not production-ready code.
